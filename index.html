    <p><p align=center><b>I</b>’ll admit that when I started this project, I felt incredibly lost. I was frustrated with the program, I felt that my ideas were lacking, and what ideas I did have, I simply didn’t know how to translate what I was seeing in my head with the tools that I was learning. Now, looking back on what I managed to produce, and the struggle I had getting there, I am honestly proud of what I’ve done – but there are definitely changes that I would make going forward. The first thing that I should have done was allow myself the time to simply play around with the program, learn its limitations, the tools it offered, and just <i>try things out</i>. I think I was so focused on the end result and trying to make something good that I forgot that I’m here to learn, and in order to do that, I need to allow myself to make mistakes and create things I don’t like. Starting over isn’t a failure, it’s just a step in the journey, and I let my perfectionism and frustration get in the way.
<br>
<br>
Based on the critiques I got from the class, I believe the best thing I could’ve done was try out different ways to reach the same conclusion. A lot of the lines and stars were transformed by hand(and mouse), which made it hard to be precise with symmetry and sizing, so although my end product was cute and got the job done, so to speak, I think it could be done a lot better using some of the tips and tricks my fellow students offered. Simply using percentages to resize the stars and make sure they’re at the correct angle would have improved the piece highly. I also uploaded the wrong file for one of the versions, which didn’t help the overall messiness of the project that I submitted (the correct file is the one without the lines).

        <p> <p align=center><b>I</b> really enjoyed this project, and working through the process of figuring out how to create what I had in my mind. The process included collecting a large amount of photos, and setting out the layers to figure out exactly where everything needed to lay. Once I had that figured out, it was a mix of masking layers, healing tool, color balance, curves, and burn and dodge to create the two separate compositions. I'm very happy with both of them, considering this was my first photoshop project. I did have to restart once, but all in all I really love what I managed to create. <br><br>Looking back at the projects after the critique, I think I would've tried to make the layer masks smoother, because I feel like my eyes get stuck on the wolf, ratehr than the over all image of the forest -- it's foreboding because there is a giant wolf, not because of the atmospher. I also would've liked to do a larger, more indepth image of the city, and perhaps will go back to create one as well.</p>

        <p> <p align=center><b>T</b>his was a very difficult project for me on a couple of different levels. Part of that was simply some technology issues, and outside factors that made creating difficult, but on top of that, I really struggled coming up with a creative idea that I liked and was passionate about, that made a statement, and that was possible, with the parameters given. My first idea involved creating a propaganda video for Marvel’s super soldier program, in order to sort of make a statement about propaganda, war profiteering, etc, however I quickly ran into a few issues. First, the message itself felt muddy and unclear, especially at a time when we’re running into a resurgence of Fascism – to paint something that is at its heart a pop culture symbol of anti-fascism in a negative light felt wrong in many ways. Secondly, I ran into the issue of needing to try to piece together something using non-copyrighted materials, which severely limited not just the video that I used, but the audio that would have actually gotten the message across. I still attempted to do so, pulling together a somewhat messy collection of clips and screenshots to try to piece it together, but in the end, it just fell flat, and when I got sick and needed an extension, I decided it would be better to find a different subject. From there, I moved onto the sacrifice of nature for the “good” of human progress, using clips of deforestation, large cities, construction, rail yards, oil spills, hunting, etc, all in black and white and complete silence in an attempt to make the viewer uncomfortable. After putting together and editing those clips, I added the sound of birds and nature over clear, fully colored clips of thriving nature, including clips of trains that work with nature rather than clearing the area around it. <br><br>During the discussion, I received critique that I agree fully with, however I didn’t make that change, because it would’ve meant completely rearranging the video, which felt like it wouldn’t be fair, as it was working off the suggestion of someone else, rather than myself. Still, if I went back to recreate this piece, I would do exactly what was suggested: flip the order of the clips. Start with the calm, warm, comfortable nature clips, and then cut to silence, to low saturation, discomfort, as a reminder of what exactly is being destroyed, and why we should care about the world around us, even as we strive towards progress.</p>

        <p> <p align=center><b>B</b>lender is an incredibly difficult program to learn how to use, and I’m embarrassed how much of the last couple of weeks was spent learning and relearning the same things as I worked on this project – every time I stopped for the day, it was as if everything got wiped from my brain. Even now, as I try to recount the steps I took for our critique discussion board. I had a hard time picking an object when we first started working on this project, but eventually I decided on a set of dice, specifically modelled after my recently retired DND character. I thought that the shapes would be simple enough that I wouldn’t get stuck on overcomplications, but that I would also learn how to make a multitude of shapes, as well as materials and numbering. I ended up making all seven dice, although two are identical (as each set comes with two d10s), as well as the dice mat that I use for my games, a brown pleather spell scroll with soft suede lining. Although there are things I would’ve added, given more time and patience (or a quicker learning curve), I’m proud of what I managed to create. If I were to continue, I would try to figure out how to make the materials and patterns more identical, and maybe figure out how to etch the numbers into the shape, rather than patterning them. The original dice are a swirling semi-translucent mix of dark blue and a murky grey green meant to look like a fast moving river Styx – perfect for my Champion of the Goddess of Death, Rook.<br><br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CyNfN5Ssrv9y9aEgG0Mk0wCKp2WtsCYW/view?usp=drive_link">Here is the link to my blender file </a></p>
